# Linux Boot Process (Modern Systems)

The Linux boot process consists of several key stages:

1. **Firmware Initialization (BIOS/UEFI)**  
   Hardware checks and firmware setup.  
2. **Bootloader (GRUB2)**  
   Loads the Linux kernel and initramfs.  
3. **Kernel Initialization**  
   Detects hardware, mounts root filesystem.  
4. **Init System (systemd)**  
   Starts services and user space.
